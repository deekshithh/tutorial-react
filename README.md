# React

A Javascript library for building interfaces.

## Components
Every web page can be split up into granular pieces called components.
* Re-usable Components make the creation of web pages easier.
* Normal HTML doesn’t have all elements/ components we need. Or existing elements lack the functionality we’re looking for.

## Why React?
* UI state becomes difficult to handle with vanilla JS.
* We need to just focus on the business logic than underlying code.
* Huge ecosystem, active community and high performance.
